<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is May from South Korea. I came to Canada to
    study English in 2009 for the first time. I was planning to stay here
    for only 1 year, but now I've settled down as a married woman and
    permanent resident here. </p>
<p>Currently I'm working as a post office team leader in London Drugs.
    Previously I had many different kinds of occupations such as
    physiotherapist, newspaper reporter, immigration consultant,
    education agent director and etc.<br />
    However, my final goal is to become a soft developer,
    therefore I'm studying very hard about programing which gives me
    excitement and fun. </p>
<p>In my free time I love to play board games. Every Saturday I go to a
meet-up in my neighborhood and make friends playing games. My most favorite games are Avalon
and Catan.<br />
My other pleasure is to play with cats. I have two cats named
    Cherry and Sangchu. I never expected this before, I'm a pet person.
    They are one of the big things in my life.
