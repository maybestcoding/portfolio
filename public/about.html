<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is May who is from South Korea. I came to Canada to 
    study English in 2009 for the first time. I was planningto stay here 
    for only 1 year, but now I've settled down as a married woman and 
    permernent resident. </p>
<p>Curently I'm working as a post office team leader in London Drugs.
    Previously I had many different kinds of occupations such as
    phsio therapist, newspaper reporter, immigration consultant,
    education agent director and etc.<br />
    However, my fincal goal is to become a soft develper, 
    therefore I'm studying very hard about programing which gives me 
    exciment and fun. </p>
<p>At my free time I love to play board games. Every Saturday I go to a 
meet-up in my neighborhood and make firends playing games. My most favorite games are Avalon 
and Catan.<br />
My another pleaser is to play with cats. I have two cats named 
    Cherry and Sangchu. I never expected before, I'm a pet person. 
    They are my one of big happiness in my life.
